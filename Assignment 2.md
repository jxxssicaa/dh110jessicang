# DH110 Heuristic Evaluation


One paragraph explaining the purpose of UT, how & what you want to test especially based on the findings of your heuristic evaluation. 

I just completed one pilot round of user testing on the New York health government website, with my friend participating as the user. The purpose of the user testing conducted was to find out how easy the New York Health goverment's website is to navigate and how simple it is to learn. I conducted this study on a participant who has never used this website before. My heuristic evaluation showed me that the main issues of the site are the navigational issues as the website has many resources, yet not a very clear way to locate the resources. Therefore, I focused 3 tasks around asking my test participant to locate several different items around the website, including finding resources and contacing the New York mayor. I wanted to see how fast he would be able to navigate around the website, and complete the tasks I had requested. 

The survey I used is linked here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRyYrSrUMNlr9zzVN0nJxZ8yn-NDAiUF91PiY5hJW_oRJjLg/viewform?usp=sf_link

My user testing confirmed my evaluation that the New York government website is extremelt unintuitive and difficult to use. The website seems clunky an doutdated, as it was missing many features that my participant had expected to see. These missing features included things like a drop down menu, and an easy way to locate resources. Clearly, these missing features are very important as my participant was unable to locate many things that he was looking to find on the website. This could be a huge problem for people who are not as technologically savvy as he was, becasue they might get too confused and then be unable to find resources. I believ taht these are critical issues that should be addressed immediately on the website to improve and the user experience for all New Yowrk citizens accessing the website. I learned that during my user testing to goivethwe particiapnt a lot of time to complete my tasks and to not rush them.I think what went well was that he was very vocal


One paragraph describing what you learned during the pilot test, what went well and what did not go well, focusing on how you want to improve your UT in the future.
