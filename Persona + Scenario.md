# Persona + Scenario 
##### Jessica Ng 

## üìñ Digital Story Telling's Purpose
UX storytelling is important because it forces you to think as the user would, and help you to share how they think. Personas can help you to image your user, and to share their needs and problems. I will be using story telling and user personas to share the problems and thought processes of my target users. These target users were created on the scenario that they would be likely users of my revised version of the New York Public Health website.


## New feature proposals for the New York Public Health website

After testing the New York Public Health website myself and with a user, I have identified some key aspects which I believe should be improved. 

 #### 1Ô∏è‚É£  Quick access to mental health resources 
 
 #### 2Ô∏è‚É£  Improved navigation for finding doctors and low health cost health clinics
