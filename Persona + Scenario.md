# Persona + Scenario

## üìñ Digital Story Telling's Purpose
UX storytelling is important because it forces you to think as the user would, and help you to share how they think. Personas can help you to image your user, and to share their needs and problems. I will be using story telling and user personas to share the problems and thought processes of my target users. These target users were created on the scenario that they would be likely users of my revised version of the New York Public Health website.


## New feature proposals for the New York Public Health website

After testing the New York Public Health website myself and with a user, I have identified some key aspects which I believe should be improved. 

 #### 1Ô∏è‚É£  Quick access to mental health resources 
 
 #### 2Ô∏è‚É£  Improved navigation for finding doctors and low health cost health clinics


## üë§ Persona & Empathy Maps

Why David is using this product

David is a retired English teacher living in Seattle with his wife. He wants to talk and interact with his grandchildren, who are ages 10 and 14 and live in San Francisco. He decides that recommending books would be a good way to connect with them, since he knows about many good classic novels. Because he reads many books at the same time, he also wants to keep track of his thoughts on a book, so that he can immediately remember where he left off in the story. However, David only needs these two features, so he really wants something that is simple to use.
How David is using this product

Since his older grandchild asked if he knows any historical fiction novels, David decides to share with him All Quiet on the Western Front. He searches the title in the search bar, then finds the book as the first result. He clicks on it, and then clicks the ‚Äúshare‚Äù button. The shared book goes to the private group he has with his grandchildren on the application. Then, he goes back to the home screen, where he clicks on the ‚Äúnotes‚Äù section, because he wants to read a book he has not touched in a few weeks. He jogs his memory by reading his notes, and starts reading the book.
