# Interactive Prototype

Jessica Ng 
DH 110: User Experience and Design

## Project Description
#### Summary

The following interactive prototype is designed to solve and illustrate three features to ease public health related issues. It helps out with findng a doctor, communicating with doctors, and locating mental health resources quickly. It comes with a doctor filtering tool to help to locate doctors with a set of filters, and locations. It uses a chat feature to speak with doctors, and finally there is a mental health tab which supports all different types of mental health resources.

#### Process

The prototype was created using Figma, a web based UI and UX application for prototyping and wireframing.
#### Purpose

The purpose of this interactive prototype is to visualize the information for the proposed tasks and features, validate the interaction flow for the user, and explore what influences a user’s choices. All in all, it is to evaluate rather than explore the system’s design.

#### Tasks

The following prototype illustrates the flow for a bundle deal even though Expedia and other travel apps offer option to book flights and hotels seperately. First, a user will input their departure and arrival city or airport. The user will then input their travel dates through a click and drag on the selected calendar dates. They can then adjust the number of travelers using the add and subtract buttons. By default, the travel budget slider is set from $0 to $1,000,000 which the user can adjust based on their budget preferences.

After tapping on the search button, the user will arrive at the hotel search results screen. They can scroll horizontally to view the previews for relevant hotels which are also positioned on a map with their price point per person. If the user taps on the price tool button, they will be directed to a new page where an option to change their search query will appear. They can either ignore or accept this suggestion, and then return to the search results. The user also has the option to sort and filter their hotel results by name, star rating, and amenities.

After tapping on a hotel, more information about the accomodation will be displayed on the next page. The user can scroll through pictures, look at reviews, and select a room. If a user taps on the reviews button, they will be directed to a new page with previous guest reviews with a score summary at the top. If the user taps on the sort button, they can sort ratings by rating, time of year, date, and keywords.

Once a user selects a room, they are directed to flight results for both outbound and inbound flights. They can scroll horizontally to view the flight options. If they click on the filter button, the user can view flights based on price, duration, stops, departure and arrival time, and airline. Once a user selects both flights and the done button, they will be directed to a summary page where they have the option to edit their hotel or flight selection. After reviewing their details and clicking on the checkout button, the user will be asked to input traveler and payment information, and whether or not they would like to purchase travel insurance. After tapping complete booking, the user has completed the interaction flow.

#### Graphic Interface

As this design closely follow Expedia’s mobile app with the implementation of three new features, I decided to adopt the travel agency’s clear, structural layout and great use of icons. Expedia’s logo colors are Dark Midnight Blue (#00355F) and Deep Lemon (#EEC218). I used color.adobe.com to explore complementary, analagous, and monochromatic variations of Midgnight Blue. I also explored color palettes related to keywords such as “travel”,”explore” and “adventure”. The final interactice prototype implements a monochromatic color palette of Midnight Blue with White.
