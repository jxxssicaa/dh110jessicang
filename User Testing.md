# DH110 User Testing 

### Jessica Ng 

## User testing Background 

I just completed one pilot round of user testing on the New York health government website. The purpose of the user testing conducted was to find out how easy the New York Health goverment's website is to navigate and how simple it is to learn. I conducted this study on a participant who has never used this website before. My heuristic evaluation showed me that the main issues of the site are the navigational issues as the website has many resources, yet not a very clear way to locate the resources. Therefore, I focused 3 tasks around asking my test participant to locate several different items around the website, including finding resources and contacting the New York mayor. I wanted to see how fast he would be able to navigate around the website, and complete the tasks I had requested. 

## 3 main  design issues: 

### 1. Match between system and the real world 

I chose this issue because I was worried that some of the wording on the New York Health home page may be confusing to different users and could be potentially interpreted differently. 

### 2. Flexibility and efficiency of use

I chose this issue because the website did not seem to have many shortcuts beyond just a search bar. It is very resource heavy, but does not provide an easy way to locate these resources. 

### 3. Aesthetic and minimalist design

I chose this issue because the website is a bit outdated in the look and feel. I wanted to see how easy it was to navigate thorugh the website given the clunky layout.

## User Testing Reflection 

My user testing confirmed my evaluation that the New York government website is extremely unintuitive and difficult to use. The website seems clunky and outdated, as it was missing many features that my participant had expected to see. These missing features included things like a drop down menu, and an easy way to locate resources. Clearly, these missing features are very important as my participant was unable to locate many things that he was looking to find on the website. This could be a huge problem for people who are not as technologically savvy as he was, becasue they might get too confused and then be unable to find resources. I believe that these are critical issues that should be addressed immediately on the website to improve and the user experience for all New York citizens accessing the website. I learned that during my user testing to give the participant a lot of time to complete my tasks and to not rush them. I think what went well was that he was very vocal during the testing, and what did not go well was the task that I asked him to do that he was unable to do. Overall, I think I can improve my UT in the future by making more clearly defined tasks and making sure to give my participant a lot of time to complete tasks.
