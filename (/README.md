# DH110 Heuristic Evaluation 
##### Jessica Ng 
##### This assignment will be evaluating two New York government websites. I will be providing feedback, and suggesting ways to improve the user experience and navigation of these websites. I hope to be able to help to make the websites more clear, and user friendly by the end of the quarter. 
## Website 1: NYC Health
