# DH110 Heuristic Evaluation  
## Public health resources in the state of New York
##### Jessica Ng 
##### About 
This assignment will be evaluating two New York public health websites for their design and usability. I will be providing feedback, and suggesting ways to improve the user experience and navigation of these websites. I hope to be able to help to make the websites more clear, and user friendly by the end. 

## Website 1: NYC Health

##### Background information: 
This website is created by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and is used to provide citizens with resources to promote and protect the city's health. They provide a broad range of services ranging from Covid-19 health, restaurant health inspections, health clinics and birth certificates. You can access the website here: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/index.page
##### Website Overall feedback: 
This website has a lot of information, and right away you notice how many tabs, links and buttons there are. It is very confusing because on the top of the home page there are 3 links, on the black banner below you can see more words that do not clearly indicate that you can click on them. Overall, there are just many unclear links and tabs available on this website, leading to a very cluttered experience. This may be very problematic for users who are coming to look for something specific but may find it difficult to locate.  

# Design Feedback

### 1. Visibility of system status
#### Good:
There is a scroller bar when scrolling down the website, so users know how long the page is. This is useful for users to be aware of where they are within the website.
#### Bad: 
There is no indication of system status when scrolling thorugh the slides on the main slideshow on the home page. This leads me to wonder where and when the slideshow ends. There is also  no feedback when typing into the search bar, such as pre populated word fetaure. 
#### Severity rating: 1
### 2. Match between system and the real world
The design uses terms and concepts that are used in the real world and presents information in a familiar manner to users.	Elevator shows an up arrow when it is going up.
#### Good:
The website uses real world applicable terms terms and so it seems familiar.
#### Bad: 
The website has icons that indicate things such as trash for "collections not in effect" and a book for "Schools not in session." These icons do not match up very well with what they are supposed to represent, and the icons are not clickable for more information.  
#### Severity rating: 2
### 3. User control and freedom
#### Bad: 
The website redirects you to a different page for some specifc resources such as NYC311 for payment. This may be confusing, and there are no clear exit signs. 
#### Severity rating: 1
### 4.Consistency and standards	
#### Good:
Search bar icon, font enlarger icon, language icon, and home icon are all standard with other websites.
#### Bad: 
As mentioned earlier in #2, there are icons used that do not match up very well with the actual meaning. These are found on the left of the slideshow on th ehomepage. Since they are on the home page, they should be adjusted. 
#### Severity rating: 1
### 5.Error prevention	
The website is designed so that error-prone conditions are eliminated or checked and presented to users before they go through with the action.	A pop-up message appears when a user tries to exit a document after inputting information without saving it.
#### Good:
There are not too many areas to input information, most of the information input is for external websites. 
#### Bad: 
When you go to the external NYC 311 website, there is no "are you sure" pop up after signing up for an account and quitting before completion. This may be annoying if you accidentally quit it after inputting all information.  
#### Severity rating: 1
### 6. Recognition rather than recall	 
#### Good:
The website uses icons to prompt users to different actions. This is identifiable and helps users to navigate the website. There is a lot of information in the contact us tab that helps users to choose which way to contact different departments. 
#### Bad: 
I do not think that this heuristic is a major problem on this website. 
#### Severity rating: 1
### 7.
Flexibility and efficiency of use	 
#### Good: 
You are able to use control F to search on this website. 
#### Bad: 
I did not notice any additional efficiency methods besides control F on this website. 
#### Severity rating: 1
### 8. 
Aesthetic and minimalist design	The website is presented in a concise and useful manner and irrelevant or excessive elements that can interfere with usability should be ommited.	Learn more button allows users to obtain additional information if they want without overloading the original page.
#### Good: 
The website uses icons for some parts of the site.
#### Bad: 
Overall, the website does not adhere to "Aesthetic and minimalist design" because it is very cluttered and has many buttons which are not clearly shown. The website could use an update on the overall look and feel to declutter and clean up the site. 
#### Severity rating: 3
### 9. 
Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
#### Good:
The NYC 311 does show people an error message if their password is entered incorrectly.
#### Bad: 
I did not notice anything major within this design heursitc on the website. 
#### Severity rating: 1
### 10.
Help and documentation	Resources are provided to clarify information and answer the questions of users.	FAQ page to answer frequently asked questions.
#### Good:
Resources are presented within departments, which may help users navogate what they are searching for. There is also a search bar at the top of the website.
#### Bad: 
There is no FAQ page. Thbis would be a useful addition to the website considering how much information and resources are contained within it. 
#### Severity rating: 1


## Website 2: New York State Office of mental Health
