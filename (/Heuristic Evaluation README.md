## Public resources in New York 
##### Jessica Ng 
##### About
This assignment will be evaluating two New York government websites. I will be providing feedback, and suggesting ways to improve the user experience and navigation of these websites. I hope to be able to help to make the websites more clear, and user friendly by the end of the quarter. 

## Website 1: NYC Health

##### Background information: 
This website is created by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and is used to provide citizens with resources to promote and protect the city's health. They provide a broad range of services ranging from Covid-19 health, restaurant health inspections, health clinics and birth certificates. You can access the website here: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/index.page
##### Website Overall feedback: 
This website has a lot of information, and right away you notice how many tabs, links and buttons there are. It is very confusing because on the top of the home page there are 3 links, on the black banner below you can see more words that do not clearly indicate that you can click on them. Overall, there are just many unclear links and tabs available on this website, leading to a very cluttered experience. This may be very problematic for users who are coming to look for something specific but may find it difficult to locate.  

# Design Feedback

### 1. Visibility of system status
#### Good:
There is a scroller bar when scrolling down the website, so users know how long the page is. 
#### Bad: 
There is no indication of system status when scrolling thorugh the slides on the main slideshow on the home page. This leads me to wonder where and when the slideshow ends. There is also  no feedback when typing into the search bar, such as pre populated word fetaure. 
#### Severity rating: 1
### 2. Match between system and the real world
The design uses terms and concepts that are used in the real world and presents information in a familiar manner to users.	Elevator shows an up arrow when it is going up.
#### Good:
The website uses real world applicable terms terms and so it seems familiar.
#### Bad: 
The website has icons that indicate things such as trash for "collections not in effect" and a book for "Schools not in session." These icons do not match up very well with what they are supposed to represent, and the icons are not clickable for more information.  
#### Severity rating: 2
### 3. User control and freedom
#### Bad: 
The website redirects you to a different page for some specifc resources such as NYC311 for payment. This may be confusing, and there are no clear exit signs. 
#### Severity rating: 1
### 4.Consistency and standards	
#### Good:
Search bar icon, font enlarger icon, language icon, and home icon are all standard with other websites.
#### Bad: 
As mentioned earlier in #2, there are icons used that do not match up very well with the actual meaning. These are found on the left of the slideshow on th ehomepage. Since they are on the home page, they should be adjusted. 
#### Severity rating: 1
### 5.Error prevention	
The website is designed so that error-prone conditions are eliminated or checked and presented to users before they go through with the action.	A pop-up message appears when a user tries to exit a document after inputting information without saving it.
#### Good:
There are not too many areas to input information, most of the information input is for external websites. 
#### Bad: 
When you go to the external NYC 311 website, there is no "are you sure" pop up after signing up for an account and quitting before completion. This may be annoying if you accidentally quit it after inputting all information.  
#### Severity rating: 1
### 6. Recognition rather than recall	The design of elements, actions, and options are clearly identifiable and information required to navigate the website is recognizable and accessible.	Microsoft Word lists out recently opened files that can be easily accessed and users do not need to remember where they saved them.
#### Good:
#### Bad: 
#### Severity rating: 1
### 7.
Flexibility and efficiency of use	The design has flexible processes for both inexperienced and experienced users so that they can pick which ever method suits them best.	Shortcuts such as 'ctrl f' allow users to find anything they want on a document or website using keywords.
#### Good:
#### Bad: 
#### Severity rating: 1
### 8. 
Aesthetic and minimalist design	The website is presented in a concise and useful manner and irrelevant or excessive elements that can interfere with usability should be ommited.	Learn more button allows users to obtain additional information if they want without overloading the original page.#### Good:
#### Bad: 
#### Severity rating: 1
### 9. 
Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors	Error message expressed in simple terms and presented so that users can recognize and solve them.	When a wrong password is inputted, the website/app notifies users that it is wrong and gives the option to create a new password through the 'Forget Password?' option.
#### Good:
#### Bad: 
#### Severity rating: 1
### 10.
Help and documentation	Resources are provided to clarify information and answer the questions of users.	FAQ page to answer frequently asked questions.
#### Good:
#### Bad: 
#### Severity rating: 1
