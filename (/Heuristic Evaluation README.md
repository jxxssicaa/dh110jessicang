# DH110 Heuristic Evaluation 
## Public resources in New York 
##### Jessica Ng 
##### This assignment will be evaluating two New York government websites. I will be providing feedback, and suggesting ways to improve the user experience and navigation of these websites. I hope to be able to help to make the websites more clear, and user friendly by the end of the quarter. 


# Heuristic	Description	Example
### 1. Visibility of system status
The design communicates clearly to users about what is going on, which allows them to learn and understand interactions with different components.	Battery status bar shows the amount of battery life remaining on a device.
### 2. 
Match between system and the real world	The design uses terms and concepts that are used in the real world and presents information in a familiar manner to users.	Elevator shows an up arrow when it is going up.
### 3. 
User control and freedom	The design allows users to correct mistakes and provides an 'emergency exit' to leave unwanted actions.	Cancel button allows user to exit the current interaction.
### 4.
Consistency and standards	The design should be consistent with other platforms and industry standards so that they are easy for users to learn the system fast.	Clicking the home icon brings you to the homepage on all websites.
### 5.
Error prevention	The website is designed so that error-prone conditions are eliminated or checked and presented to users before they go through with the action.	A pop-up message appears when a user tries to exit a document after inputting information without saving it.
### 6.
Recognition rather than recall	The design of elements, actions, and options are clearly identifiable and information required to navigate the website is recognizable and accessible.	Microsoft Word lists out recently opened files that can be easily accessed and users do not need to remember where they saved them.
### 7.
Flexibility and efficiency of use	The design has flexible processes for both inexperienced and experienced users so that they can pick which ever method suits them best.	Shortcuts such as 'ctrl f' allow users to find anything they want on a document or website using keywords.
### 8. 
Aesthetic and minimalist design	The website is presented in a concise and useful manner and irrelevant or excessive elements that can interfere with usability should be ommited.	Learn more button allows users to obtain additional information if they want without overloading the original page.
### 9. 
Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors	Error message expressed in simple terms and presented so that users can recognize and solve them.	When a wrong password is inputted, the website/app notifies users that it is wrong and gives the option to create a new password through the 'Forget Password?' option.
### 10.
Help and documentation	Resources are provided to clarify information and answer the questions of users.	FAQ page to answer frequently asked questions.

## Website 1: NYC Health

##### Background information: 
This website is created by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and is used to provide citizens with resources to promote and protect the city's health. They provide a broad range of services ranging from Covid-19 health, restaurant health inspections, health clinics and birth certificates. You can access the website here: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/index.page
##### Website Overall feedback: 
This website has a lot of information, and right away you notice how many tabs, links and buttons there are. It is very confusing because on the top of the home page there are 3 links, on the black banner below you can see more words that do not clearly indicate that you can click on them. Overall, there are just many unclear links and tabs available on this website, leading to a very cluttered experience. This may be very problematic for users who are coming to look for something specific but may find it difficult to locate.  

# Design Feedback


## Website 2: New York State Library
