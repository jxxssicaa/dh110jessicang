# Low-Fidelity Prototype

Jessica Ng 

DH110: User Experience Design

## Project Description


The current project aims to resolve user issues with public health resources and getting help from mental health specialists and doctors. The target community are people who need access to lower cost, near-by, and easy access healthcare. Target users need quick and easy ways to contact doctors or find help for their physical or mental needs. They value ease of use, access to resources, and prefer a desktop version. User personas were created off of a young professional seking help for mental health, and an old lady who is looking for a new doctor in her city.  

The purpose of this low fidelity protype is to test both the flow and functionality these extra features would require when added onto a public health website.  

 Due to my previous user research, the features that would be most beneficial to the target users are listed below.

#### 1. Direct and easy access to mental health resources 
Located directly on home page, and linking to various resources.
#### 2. Messaging and filtering through doctors 
Locating and messaging nearby doctors and mental health physicians based on price and location.
