# Low-Fidelity Prototype

Jessica Ng 

DH110: User Experience Design

## Project Description


The current project aims to resolve user issues with public health resources and getting help from mental health specialists and doctors. The target community are people who need access to lower cost, near-by, and easy access healthcare. Target users need quick and easy ways to contact doctors or find help for their physical or mental needs. They value ease of use, access to resources, and prefer a desktop version. User personas were created off of a young professional seking help for mental health, and an old lady who is looking for a new doctor in her city.  

The purpose of this low fidelity protype is to test both the flow and functionality these extra features would require when added onto a public health website.  

 Due to my previous user research, the features that would be most beneficial to the target users are listed below.

#### 1. Direct and easy access to mental health resources 
Located directly on home page, and linking to various resources.
#### 2. Messaging and filtering through doctors 
Locating and messaging nearby doctors and mental health physicians based on price and location.



## Tasks

The low-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:

Access menal health resource page 
Find a doctor with filter options 
Look at doctor's location from you 
Look at the doctor's profiles
Message the doctor 

## Wireframes and Wireflows


Flow Description: The flow allows people to directly search for a doctor based on their needs. They can apply filters to help select a docotr for either their physical or mental health easily. The filters include things such as sorting by price, location, or reccomended. The users can continue to narrow down their results by adding on if they need a mental health or physical health specialist, as well as type into the search bar the issues that they have. After the user inputs their desired settings, they will be led to a page with map and list of nearby doctors that match their selections. The user can click on the map to see where exactly all the doctors are located. Or the user can select a doctor and they will be taken to a page where they can see the doctors picture, a reference of what items from the checklist the doctor has, and an option to message the doctor's office. The user can then click on the message button to directly chat on the website, or they can refer to the doctors number.


The flow intends for the user to search for their bundle trip based on their departure and arrival city or airport, dates of travel, number of travelers, and travel budget (optional). Based on the hotel results, a user can sort or filter the list by hotel name, star rating, and amenities. After clicking on a hotel, a user can view and sort ratings based on their search query and trip purpose. After selecting the room, a user will select an inbound and outbound flight to and from their travel destination. Again, based on their search results, a user has the option to sort or filter flights by duration, stops, time, and airline. After selecting both flights, the user will be directed to a trip summary of their hotel and flight selections. The user has the option to change their selections. If they are satisfied with their selections, the user can proceed to pay for their flight. They will input their passenger and payment details and have the option to insure their trip. Clicking on "Complete Booking" signifies the completion of the travel booking process.

Features Description: The price tool feature takes the user's input from their travel budget. If the user clicks on the Price Tool button, they will be directed to a new page where they have the option to change their search field to view more cost-efficient price options. For example, changing their departure airport to BUR from LAX. Cheaper flights will help lower the overall cost per person. The minimized flight booking process is reflected in a combined flight view. A user is able to select their inbound and outbound flight on the same screen, minimizing scrolling time and directing the user straight to booking. Flights are displayed by Recommended as default. The most important flight details are displayed, such as time, airline, flight duration, and price. If the user would like to see more flight details on the airline's website, they can click "See More". The recommendation tool feature is reflected in the hotel search results, displaying the highest recommended hotels on the top of the page. When viewing hotel reviews, the main points of the hotel's average rating are displayed at the top of the screen, such as Cleanliness, Service, Comfort, Condition, and Location. If the user clicks Sort, they have the option to customize the reviews based on the time of year, traveler type, and keyword in addition to rating and date.
