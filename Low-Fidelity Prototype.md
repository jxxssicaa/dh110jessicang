DH110: User Experience Design

## Project Description

 Brief summary of user-research, persona and the features you wrote as usage scenario; The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping
 
The current project seeks to solve user difficulties associated with travel planning. The target community is a community of travelers that seek adventure, travel to new places, spend time with friends and family, and never feel settled in one place. These users are a group of people with long, drawn-out network ties in multiple cities, countries, and continents looking to explore. Based on user research, the following features seek to solve the common constraints of travel-planning.

Price Tool - suggests what details of your trip to change (such as travel dates, location, airport) in order to fit a designated budget and price range 
Minimized Booking Process - compares all airlines and websites and arranges flights by price visibility with personal recommendations, takes user directly to checkout after selecting flights 
Recommendation Tool - Summarizes main points of customer reviews, shows highly recommended

The current project aims to resolve user issues with public health resources and getting help from mental health specialists and doctors. The target community are people who need access to lower cost, near-by, and easy access healthcare. Due to my previous user research, the features that would be most beneficial to the target users are listed below.
