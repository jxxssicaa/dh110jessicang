# Low-Fidelity Prototype

Jessica Ng 

DH110: User Experience Design

## Project Description


The current project aims to resolve user issues with public health resources and getting help from mental health specialists and doctors. The target community are people who need access to lower cost, near-by, and easy access healthcare. Target users need quick and easy ways to contact doctors or find help for their physical or mental needs. They value ease of use, access to resources, and prefer a desktop version. User personas were created off of a young professional seking help for mental health, and an old lady who is looking for a new doctor in her city.  

The purpose of this low fidelity protype is to test both the flow and functionality these extra features would require when added onto a public health website.  

 Due to my previous user research, the features that would be most beneficial to the target users are listed below.

#### 1. Direct and easy access to mental health resources 
Located directly on home page, and linking to various resources.
#### 2. Messaging and filtering through doctors 
Locating and messaging nearby doctors and mental health physicians based on price and location.



## Tasks

The low-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:

1) Access mental health resource page 


2) Find a doctor with filter options 

3) Look at doctor's location from you 


4) Look at the doctor's profiles


5) Message the doctor

#### Flow Description:

The flow allows people to directly search for a doctor based on their needs. They can apply filters to help select a doctor for either their physical or mental health easily. The users can continue to narrow down their results by adding on if they need a mental health or physical health specialist, as well as type into the search bar the issues that they have. After the user inputs their desired settings, they will be led to a page with map and list of nearby doctors that match their selections. The user can click on the map to see where exactly all the doctors are located. Or the user can select a doctor and they will be taken to a page where they can see the doctors picture, a reference of what items from the checklist the doctor has, and an option to message the doctor's office. The user can then click on the message button to directly chat on the website, or they can refer to the doctors number.


#### Features Description:

The search for doctor feature allows the user to input what is important to them, and then easily selcet a doctor from a list. They can use the filter option which   includes things such as sorting by price, location, or reccomended. Next, when they are taken to a page of doctors that fit their search criteria, they can use the maps feature to learn who is the closets by. They can evenb look at the doctors user reviews to help them select a doctor from this page. When they do, this will lead them to the doctors page where they can use the doctor description or message feature to learn more about the doctor or message their office. The message feature will take them to another page that will contain chat history with the specific doctors office that they are trying to contact.
