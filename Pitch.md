# New York Public Health 

### Jessica Ng | DH110 | Fall 2021

## Introduction

a brief information about the project. What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.

This project was to improve a government website, and the state I had chosen was New York. Specifically, I chose the New York Public Health page. I conducted a heuristic evaluation on it, and then created a new app version of the website to promote ease and usability. I was motivated to choose this project because mental and physical health is something that is very important,m and I believe that everybody should have easy access to resources which will help them improve their health.  

## Clear design statement:

What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project?

The issue with the New York Public Health website is that it is very cluttered, and hard to navihate. I wanted to attempt to make it more accessiblble by making the intercae easier to use.

## User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:

I want to create a website that empowers the public to access public health resource that their state provides. I noticed a disconnect between public health resources that were availible and people actually being aware of usuch resources. This project will help users locate public health resources and people to contact in a straightforward and intuitive manner.

## UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]

UX storytelling is important because it forces you to think as the user would, and help you to share how they think. Personas can help you to imagine your users, and to share their needs and problems. I will be using story telling and user personas to share the problems and thought processes of my target users. These target users were created on the scenario that they would be likely users of the New York Public Health website.

## High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)

The following interactive prototype is designed to solve and illustrate three features to ease public health related issues. It helps out with findng a doctor, communicating with doctors, and locating mental health resources quickly. It comes with a doctor filtering tool to help to locate doctors with a set of filters, and locations. It uses a chat feature to speak with doctors, and finally there is a mental health tab which supports all different types of mental health resources.
