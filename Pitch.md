# New York Public Health Accessibility

### Jessica Ng | DH110 | Fall 2021

## Introduction

a brief information about the project. What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.

My UX project was to improve a government website, and the state I had chosen was New York. Specifically, I chose the New York Public Health page as I am interested in public health accessibility. I conducted a heuristic evaluation on the New York Public Health website, and then created an app version of the website to promote ease and usability. I was motivated to choose this project because mental and physical health is something that is very important, and I believe that everybody should have easy access to resources which will help them improve their health.  

## Clear design statement

What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project?

The issue with the New York Public Health website is that it is very cluttered, and hard to navigate. There was a lot of information, and was very overwhelming upon initial impressions. I wanted to attempt to make it more accessibile by making the interface easier to use. I believe that cleaning up the interface would make this app easier to use for people who are not as technologically sound, or those having urgent health issues. 

## Competitor analysis

 Summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the existing product(s) - or the original website you evaluated
 
First, I started by evaluating two New York public health websites for their design and usability. I provided feedback, and suggested ways to improve the user experience and navigation of these websites. I hope to be able to help to make the websites more clear, and user friendly by the end.

## User research

I want to create a website that empowers the public to access public health resource that their state provides. Thorugh my interviews, I noticed a disconnect between public health resources that were availible and people actually being aware of usuch resources. This project will help users locate public health resources and people to contact in a straightforward and intuitive manner.

## UX storytelling

UX storytelling is important because it forces you to think as the user would, and help you to share how they think. Personas can help you to imagine your users, and to share their needs and problems. I usedstory telling and user personas to share the problems and thought processes of my target users. These target users were created on the scenario that they would be likely users of the New York Public Health website.

## Wireframe and graphic design element variation 

I decided to create a mobile app with features that my test users had requested, and based on changes and features that I believed should be implemented after conducting a heuristic evaluation. I created this interface design on Figma and created an entirely new mobile app version of the New York public health website. 

My project has the following features:

1) Mental health resources
2) Adding a "Find a Doctor" feature with location and filter results
3) Adding a chat center for messaging Doctors

## Low-fidelity prototype  

Summary and link to the sketches (may contains the multiple versions and evaluation history)

The purpose of this low fidelity protype is to test both the flow and functionality these extra features would require when added onto a public health websites app.

## High-fidelity prototype  

The following interactive prototype is designed to solve and illustrate three features to ease public health related issues. It helps out with findng a doctor, communicating with doctors, and locating mental health resources quickly. It comes with a doctor filtering tool to help to locate doctors with a set of filters, and locations. It uses a chat feature to speak with doctors, and finally there is a mental health tab which supports all different types of mental health resources.

## Optional evaluation and revision history

Including cognitive walkthrough; impression test, accessibility audit, usability testing), per each summary and link to the notes (when you share the video or other detailed evidences, I will notify you when you can make the contents private as soon as your work is graded)

## Conclusion: what did you learn throughout the process?

Overall, I learned from this project the design process behind creating a usable app. I was able to conduct research and testing which helped to structure the features that I wanted to include into my final app design.
