# Interface Design 
### DH 110 User Experience and Design 
#### Jessica Ng 



### Project Description and Purpose

My project focuses on improving the New York Public Health website after conducting user testing on the flow. I decided to create a mobile app with features that my test users had requested, and based on changes and features that I believed should be implemented after conducting a heuristic evaluation. I created this interface design on Figma and created an entirely new mobile app version of the New York public health website. 

My project has the following features:

1) Mental health resources
2) Adding a "Find a Doctor" feature with location and filter results
3) Adding a chat center for messaging Doctors

### Decision Making Process 

My final graphical design was focused on making the user experience as easy as possible, and making sure that the user felt like it was simple to locate things that they are looking for. This decision was based on how difficult it was to navigate the original New York Public Health website. Therefore, I included back buttons and the top tab bar in every page so that the user would never feel stuck, and would be able to easily go back, or go onto another page through the tab bar. Next, I made the flow of choices very vlear with the big buttons on the home page. I also wanted to use more icons that are easily recognizable such as the message buttons, back buttons, and search bar. I decided to choose the purple color family for my color choice after checking color contrasts on Spark plugin. Finally, I decided on sans seriff font to create a clean and modern look and feel to the app.

### Impression Test

I asked my test user to try and complete three tasks. 

These three tasks are listed as follows: 

1. Message a doctor
2. Find the location map of doctors nearby
3. Locate the mental health hotline

My test user was able to quickly complete all three tasks without roadblocks or problems. The video evidence of the user testing conducted is here:
