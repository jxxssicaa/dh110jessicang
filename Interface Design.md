# Interface Design 
### DH 110 User Experience and Design 
#### Jessica Ng 


A brief description of your project, the purpose and process of this interface design (3-5 sentences)

My project focuses on improving the New York Public Health website after conducting user testing on the flow. I decided to create a mobile app with features that my test users had requested, and based on changes and features that I believed should be implemented after conducting a heaursitic evaluation. I created this interface design on Figma and cretaed an entirely new mobile app version of the New York public health website. 

I decided to focus on the following features:

1) Making mental health a priority and making it easily accessible directly from the home page 
2) Adding a "Find a Doctor" feature with location and filter results
3) Adding a chat center for messaging Doctors
