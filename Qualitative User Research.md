# Qualitative User Research

## ✅ Step 1: Specify the Main Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?

This project will help users locate public health resources and people to contact in a straightforward and intuitive manner.  

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?

This activity fulfills the user’s safety needs because keeping one's health in check falls under this hierarchy. By being able to easily locate health resources, one will feel more connected with their community and stay in good physical and mental health.  

#### What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?

The traditional solution to locate resources is to go to doctors offices, government buildings, health clinics, Google search, or get reccomendations from friends or family. 

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

Limitations iclude not being awar eof all the resources offered, and not knowing how to get in touch with your desired department.  

## ✅ Step 2: Target Users 

#### What are the characteristics of users?

Demographics: students (high school, college undergraduates), working adults, and people who are college-educated
Preferences: users read as a hobby, or want to read for personal development, and thus would want to keep track of books they read and get book recommendations
Expertise: users would not need any particular level of expertise for this project
#### Where would the users do that activity?

Users can keep track of books anywhere; in the traditional method, as long as they have a piece of paper and pen, they can write down what book they read. In a digital method, users can log what they read anywhere at anytime, as long as they have their device.
When finding books to read, users may do that activity in many different places—a library or a bookstore, or even in daily conversations with their family, friends, or co-workers, or online in an online book recommendation.
#### What would the users do to complete that activity?

The goal of the users would be to log a book they read. To do that, they would either physically write down information about that book, or type it in a device to record information. To find a book to read, users may search online, go to a library or bookstore to browse books on their own or ask the staff, or ask their friends or family about book recommendations.
