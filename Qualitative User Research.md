# Qualitative User Research

## ✅ Step 1: Specify the Main Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?

I want to create a website that empowers the public to access public health resource that their state provides. I noticed a disconnect between public health resources that were availible and people actually being aware of usuch resources. This project will help users locate public health resources and people to contact in a straightforward and intuitive manner.  

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?

This activity fulfills the user’s safety needs because keeping one's health in check falls under this hierarchy. By being able to easily locate health resources, one will feel more connected with their community and stay in good physical and mental health.  

#### What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?

The traditional solution to locate resources is to go to doctors offices, government buildings, health clinics, Google search, or get reccomendations from friends or family. 

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

Limitations include not being aware of all the resources offered, and not knowing how to get in touch with your desired department.  

## ✅ Step 2: Target Users 

#### What are the characteristics of users?

Demographics: students, working adults, and anyone with internet access

Preferences: Users who are interested in public health resources, and community resources. 

## ✅ Step 3: Pick Research Methods

I chose to conduct contextual inquiry thorugh a virtual interview. I chose this method because I wanted to get a first hand account of the issues people face while locating resources online. The interview was conducted over Zoom.

#### Interview Insights

 
1️⃣ User feels that finding public health resources is very important. 

Q: How important is it for you to be able to find public health resources online and why?

A: Very important because you cannot just go to the hospital anytime. You know how a hospital works right or clinics work, you have to make an appointment, and then when get there you have to wait for a long time, even when you're already on time, you have to wait for one hour and only get to talk to a doctor for five minutes, so it's very important to be able to find information online and do self diagnosis first.

2️⃣ The user feels a disconnect between resources and citizens knowing what resources are availible.

Q: Do you think there is a disconnect between government health resources available, and people having knowledge of what is available?

A: Yeah, I definitely think so, yes. Yeah, I know many people don't know California actually has medical, which is a California free medical insurance for low income people. So, this information is not advertised very much by the state.

3️⃣ Finding someone to actually speak with is a big problem. 

Q: What is the most difficult problem you face when searching for public resources online? 

A: Finding someone to talk to. It's very difficult because you can see all information, but it's almost impossible to find someone to actually talk to you, unless you go to see a doctor. So you'd be nice to have to find somebody to talk to them. This person can give you some guidance for all and can actually give you some pointers, where to go, what to do.


## ✅ Step 5: Reflection

The contextual inquiry process was very helpful to me when considering things from a users point of view. I learned a lot from the interview, and discovered what is actually important to a user who needs to locate public health resources. One of the most interesting insights that I gained during this process was that my user felt there was a big problem in being able to actually find someone to contact and speak with. My user also re confirmed my suspicion that there was a disconnect between resources available and how to identify them. She used an example of Medi Cal insurance in California being availible, but not everybody knowing about it. Some difficulties I faced were being unbiased during the interview,I know my user very well. I struggled a bit in choosing out what questions I wanted to ask her,because of this issue. I also think that I worded some questions in a way that would have made my user reply in a way that she thought I wanted her to. Therefore, I believe that there was some response bias due to my questions. This is something that I want to improve on next time, and create more objective and open ended quetsions. 

felt a lot more fluid and natural than usability testing, most likely because this was more about what, why, and how a user does an activity and less about a particular product. Asking and observing the user gave me a lot of interesting insight. For example, I did not expect the user to want to log a book as a creative outlet. It was also interesting to find out that part of the motivation for recording books was to recommend them to other people. Unfortunately, I had to use the same participant as my usability test (due to stay-at-home orders because of COVID-19), but I was still able to find a lot of new perspectives about what a user is looking for when he/she is looking for a book and keeping track of it. Another difficulty was I was not sure if there was response bias. Because the participant had been a part of the usability test and knew what kind of product I was examining, maybe she knew what kind of answers I wanted for these questions. In addition, some of my questions may have been biased and could have tried to lead the user to answer a certain way. For example, I gave examples of answers in my questions (e.g. "How would you judge a book? Do you look at the summary, the cover, the author...?"), which may have led to some biased answers. Next time, I want to be really aware of the questions I am asking to try to prevent any kind of bias. I would also want to ask a different person for my contextual interview, and possibly ask multiple people from my target user group.
