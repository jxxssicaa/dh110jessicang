# Qualitative User Research

## ✅ Step 1: Specify the Main Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?

I want to create a website that empowers the public to access public health resource that their state provides. I noticed a disconnect between public health resources that were availible and people actually being aware of usuch resources. This project will help users locate public health resources and people to contact in a straightforward and intuitive manner.  

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?

This activity fulfills the user’s safety needs because keeping one's health in check falls under this hierarchy. By being able to easily locate health resources, one will feel more connected with their community and stay in good physical and mental health.  

#### What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?

The traditional solution to locate resources is to go to doctors offices, government buildings, health clinics, Google search, or get reccomendations from friends or family. 

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

Limitations include not being aware of all the resources offered, and not knowing how to get in touch with your desired department.  

## ✅ Step 2: Target Users 

#### What are the characteristics of users?

Demographics: students, working adults, and anyone with internet access

Preferences: Users who are interested in public health resources, and community resources. 

## ✅ Step 3: Pick Research Methods

#### Methods

I chose to conduct contextual inquiry thorugh a virtual interview. I chose this method because I wanted to get a first hand account of the issues people face while locating resources online. The interview was conducted over Zoom.
